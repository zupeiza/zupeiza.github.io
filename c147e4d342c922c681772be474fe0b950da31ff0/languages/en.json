    "lejos-long": "<h2>Lodging<\/h2><p>The celebration will take place in the Val Miñor area, a popular touristic destination with many services, intersected by the portuguese Saint James' Way. There are lodgings of many types in the area: from a luxury inn (parador) in Baiona to a bungalows camping in Nigrán. There are also some hotels in this region of Val Miñor (there are more hotels in Vigo, about 15min away by car), but the most common lodgings are countryside hostels and apartments.<\/p><p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/meetrural.com\/directorio?nameandtitle=&locationagregation=&field_town_hall=&field_heritage=&field_entity_groups_1%5B532%5D=532&field_entity_groups_1%5B539%5D=539&field_entity_groups_1%5B536%5D=536&field_entity_groups_1%5B540%5D=540&field_entity_groups_1%5B535%5D=535&field_entity_groups_1%5B537%5D=537&field_entity_groups_1%5B534%5D=534&field_entity_groups_1%5B533%5D=533&field_entity_groups_1%5B538%5D=538&field_entity_groups_1%5B1119%5D=1119\" target=\"blank\">this address<\/a> you can find some lodgings in the area.<\/p><h2>Travel<\/h2><p>Many of you, lovely people invited to the wedding, have decided to live far or very far away; so we want to make easier the travel arrangements. In order to do that, we listed here some resources that might be useful.<\/p><p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rome2rio.com\/en\/\" target=\"blank\">this website<\/a> you can see a potential transport combination according to your travel origin and destination. Anyway, we propose some ideas.<\/p><h3>By road<\/h3><\/h2><p>If you have a car, your best friend is Google Maps, or something equivalent. What won't be your best friend are the AP-9 tolls...<\/p><p>Otherwise, if you like strong emotions, you can take a look in Blablacar, you might be lucky and find one doing your same route. It is quite budget-friendly, but there is a risk of last-minute cancellation.<\/p><p>Another option is bus travel. <a href=\"https:\/\/estacionautobusesvigo.es\/\" target=\"blank\">These<\/a> are the bus operators for Vigo.<\/p><h3>By plane<\/h3><p>The closest airport is Vigo Peinador, about 30kms from the wedding venue (around 30mins by car). If you don't have/rent a car, there are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vitrasa.es\/lineas-y-horarios-85_A\" target=\"blank\">A buses<\/a> each 35mins (except by night), although if you let us know when you are coming we could arrange for someone nice (even ourselves) to get you. <\/p><p>Other close airports are the Santiago de Compostela airport, about 130km (1h 30min by car), and the Porto airport, about 140km (1h 40min by car) from the wedding venue, those could be interesting since they manage more travel routes than the Vigo airport and they have busses to Vigo.<\/p><h3>By train<\/h3><p>Trains from out of Galicia reach Vigo through the route Madrid-Vigo. They are high speed trains, but the trip is quite long, so take it into account to choose which books or movies you want to watch during the journey.<\/p><h2>Transport to the wedding venue<\/h2><p>In any case, if you find difficulties with transport, let us know. Maybe we can arrange some collective transport or find cars for the trip.<\/p><h2>Sightseeing<\/h2><p>Remember this area and in general all Galicia is a magical place where you can visit the beach, mountains, hot springs... and many gastronomical and musical festivals. If you come before the wedding we could help you as guides (or we could enroll you in a roleplaying game, wink wink) - after the wedding we'll be busy with other stuff and probably all we can do is give you a big hug and bid you farewell.<\/p><p>There is always the option to extend your visit and do some sightseeing knowing these beautiful places, and even make a short trip to the <a href=\"https:\/\/lasislascies.com\/\" title=\"IMPORTANTE: Reservar la visita con meses de antelación\" target=\"blank\">Cíes islands<\/a> or around Tui, monumental city.<\/p>",
